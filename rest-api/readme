You must have you database built locally using the sql files in this repo to populate the tables. XXAMP is the current solution we are using to host locally

Install:

cd into rest-API
npm install
npm start

The lister is opened on port 5000 of your local host and is the location to send requests. e.g: http://localhost:5000/
